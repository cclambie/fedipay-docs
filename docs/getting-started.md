# Getting Started

This documentation covers both:

- **Users**: install a client (browser extension / app integration) and set a monthly budget
- **Operators**: run a FediPay server to receive events and compute allocations

## Choose your path

- [For Users (Extension)](users/extension.md)
- [For Operators (Server)](operators/server.md)

## Core idea

FediPay works by turning your consumption into a privacy-minimal stream of events, then computing an allocation plan.

Example (conceptual):

- You set £10/month
- You spend 50% of your tracked attention on Creator A and 50% on Creator B
- FediPay suggests ~£5/£5 (with caps, pins, exclusions, etc.)
