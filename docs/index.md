# FediPay Docs

FediPay is a federated, user-owned tool for supporting creators and Free/Open Source Software based on what you actually read, watch, and use.

## What exists today

FediPay is currently focused on the **Allocation Phase**:

- Collect privacy-minimal “usage events” locally (extension/app)
- Sync events to a user-controlled server
- Compute a fair monthly allocation plan (“who to pay, and how much”)
- Export/share results and links (payments handled manually for now)

## What’s next

- Better coverage across the fediverse and the open web (RSS/WordPress, podcasts)
- SDKs for apps and developers
- Optional federated settlement (server-to-server) later
