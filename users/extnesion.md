# For Users: Browser Extension (planned)

## Status

The browser extension is under active development.

## What it will do

- Track **opt-in** usage events (e.g. “viewed a post”, “watched a video”, “read an article”)
- Keep data local-first, syncing only to **your** FediPay server
- Let you review what’s collected and exclude domains/accounts

## What it won’t do

- It will not upload page content
- It will not perform cross-site ad-tech style tracking
- It will not require a central account

## Next steps

- Follow development on GitHub
- Watch the `Specs` section for event and API formats
